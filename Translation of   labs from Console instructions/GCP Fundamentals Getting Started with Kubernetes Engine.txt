Lab Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE


Objectives

 --In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

 --Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

 --Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.


Steps

1  Click the Open Cloud Shell button

2 Place the zone into an environment variable called MY_ZONE with this command prompt 


         export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a


3 Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:


        gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

        This might take a few minutes.


4 After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes


        kubectl version


       The gcloud container clusters create command automatically authenticated kubectl for you. 



5 check your vm instances with this command prompt

        gcloud compute instances list


6 Run and deploy a container

        1  launch a single instance of the nginx container with this command

                     kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

                    ''kubectl create command caused Kubernetes to create a deployment consisting of a single pod containing the nginx container''


        2 View the pod running the nginx container:


                    kubectl get pods


       3 Expose the nginx container to the Internet

                   kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer


       4 View the new service

                   kubectl get services

       5 Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar


                   Result: The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed


       6 Scale up the number of pods running on your service use this command 



                   kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

                 ''Scaling up a deployment is useful when you want to increase available resources for an application that is becoming more popular.''



       7 Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods


                  kubectl get pods


        8 Confirm that your external IP address has not changed


                   kubectl get services


         9 Return to the web browser tab in which you viewed your cluster's external IP address. Refresh the page to confirm that the nginx web server is still responding

                 
                    Result: The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed
